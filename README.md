# 💰 Expense Tracker

A simple expense tracker built with **TypeScript**, **SCSS**, and **LocalStorage**.  
This project is perfect for practicing DOM manipulation, forms, typing in TypeScript, and persistent storage in the browser.

## 🔍 Project Overview

Users can input and track their expenses by providing a name and amount.  
Each expense is saved to the browser's `localStorage` and displayed in a list with the total sum.  
Individual expenses can also be deleted.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- ⚙️ **TypeScript** — for type-safe logic and working with the DOM  
- 🎨 **SCSS** — for styling with variables, nesting, and cleaner structure  
- 💾 **LocalStorage** — to persist data across sessions  
- ⚡ **Vite** — for fast development and bundling
